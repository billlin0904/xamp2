# import the gist module

# ====================== Setting up ===================

# Commented out for now

# Get the sampling frequency
#fs = gist.getSamplingFrequency()

# Set the sampling frequency
#gist.setSamplingFrequency (48000)

# Set the audio frame size that the module expects
#gist.setAudioFrameSize (512)

# ====================== Extracting Features ===================

# This example shows how to get features from a single audio frame

# Create an arbitrary sin wave as an audio frame
audioFrame = np.sin (np.arange((512.)) * np.pi / 180. * 4 )

# Process the audio frame
gist.processFrame (audioFrame)

# Now we extract features and print them out...
