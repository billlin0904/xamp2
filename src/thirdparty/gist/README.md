Usage
-----

Firstly, import the Gist header file:

	#include "Gist.h"
	
##### Instantiation	

Gist is a template class, so instantiate it with floating point precision:

	int frameSize = 512;
	int sampleRate = 44100;

	Gist<float> gist (frameSize, sampleRate);
	
Or with double precision:

	Gist<double> gist (frameSize, sampleRate);

We proceed with the documentation as if we were using floating point precision.

##### Process Audio Frames		

Once you have an audio frame, pass it to the Gist object. You can do this either as a STL vector:
	
	std::vector<float> audioFrame;
	
	// !
	// fill audio frame with samples here
	// !
	
	gist.processAudioFrame (audioFrame);
	
Or, as an array:

	float audioFrame[512];
	
	// !
	// fill audio frame with samples here
	// !
	
	gist.processAudioFrame (audioFrame, 512);
	
Now we can retrieve some audio features.
	
##### Core Time Domain Features
	
	// Root Mean Square (RMS)
	float rms = gist.rootMeanSquare();
	
	// Peak Energy
	float peakEnergy = gist.peakEnergy();
	
	// Zero Crossing rate
	float zcr = gist.zeroCrossingRate();
	
##### Core Frequency Domain Features
	
	// Spectral Centroid
	float specCent = gist.spectralCentroid();
	
    // Spectral Crest
    float specCrest = gist.spectralCrest();
    
    // Spectral Flatness
    float specFlat = gist.spectralFlatness();
    
    // Spectral Rolloff
    float specRolloff = gist.spectralRolloff();
    
    // Spectral Kurtosis
    float specKurtosis = gist.spectralKurtosis();

##### Onset Detection Functions
    
    // Energy difference
    float ed = gist.energyDifference();
    
    // Spectral difference
    float sd = gist.spectralDifference();
    
    // Spectral difference (half-wave rectified)
    float sd_hwr = gist.spectralDifferenceHWR();
    
    // Complex Spectral Difference
    float csd = gist.complexSpectralDifference();
    
    // High Frequency Content
    float hfc = gist.highFrequencyContent();
    
##### FFT Magnitude Spectrum

	// FFT Magnitude Spectrum
	const std::vector<float>& magSpec = gist.getMagnitudeSpectrum();
	
##### Pitch

	// Pitch Estimation
	float pitch = gist.pitch();

##### Mel-frequency Representations

	// Mel-frequency Spectrum
	const std::vector<float>& melSpec = gist.getMelFrequencySpectrum();
	
	// MFCCs
	const std::vector<float>& mfcc = gist.getMelFrequencyCepstralCoefficients();

Dependencies
------------

The Gist library depends on one of the following FFT libraries:

* [FFTW](http://fftw.org) 

You will need to install this yourself, link projects using -lfftw3 and use the flag -DUSE_FFTW

* [Kiss FFT](http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/) - included with project

This is included with the project. To use Kiss FFT, add the flag -DUSE_KISS_FFT

* [Apple Accelerate FFT](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/vDSP_Programming_Guide/UsingFourierTransforms/UsingFourierTransforms.html)

To use Accelerate FFT, add the flag -DUSE_ACCELERATE_FFT
